# ParkKL
This code is for final year project application developed by Karim Saleh to fulfill the requirements of Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation for the degree of Bachelor (Hons) in Software Engineering

The main purpose of ParkKL is to help users to pay for their street public parking in Kuala Lumpur. Since the common street public parking payment model is not efficient enough.
In the current model, the driver has to find the payment machine, and input his car number plate, then choose the duration he wish to park, after that he can pay for the parking.
Usually there are some issues come with this model such as (1) Lack of coins with the driver (2) Long queues in front of the machines (3) High cost for installationa and maintenance.

ParkKL provide two interfacce, one for drivers where they can top up and pay for parking, and one for parking officers who can check the parking sessions for cars, and issue penalties in case parking time exceeded.

ParkKL can easily fix those issues by allowing the user to have his own wallet, which can be topped up by credit card, then pay easily for his parking.
Features in ParkKL includes but not limited to (1) Small map for location detection (2) Top up of wallet (3) Payment for parking (4) Active parking session recognition (5) Extending parking
(6) Payment for parking penalties

ParkKL was developed using Xamarin.Android, and the backend is hosted in Azure Mobile Services instance with small SQL database.
